## How to execute it

Download the **<kbd>repository</kbd>** as a **<kbd>.zip</kbd>** file clicking on **<kbd>Code</kbd>** and then on **<kbd>Download ZIP</kbd>**.

Unzip it, Open Visual Studio Code with the project. Then, click on **<kbd>New terminal</kbd>**.

In the terminal, write that line and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:
```
go run main.go
```

Then, it should display that:
```
Server is running...
If the navigator didn't open on its own, just go to  http://localhost:8080/  on your browser.
If you want to end the server, type 'stop' here :
```
_Don't close the terminal, otherwise, the server will stop automatically._

When you open your browser at the right *url*, you can then access the website.

To stop the server, return to the terminal and type ```stop```, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

A lot of information should be displayed in the terminal, because the program is currently quite verbose. Just don't worry about it.
